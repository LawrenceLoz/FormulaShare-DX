    <description>Holds dynamic rules defining sharing logic for the org. NOTE rules are now set up through the FormulaShare app, available to users with the &quot;FormulaShare Admin&quot; permission set. Whilst metadata can still be created and edited directly it&apos;s strongly recommended you manage rules through the app instead, which ensures rules are valid and allows easy monitoring</description>
