    <description>If a record is set up here for a standard object, any sharing on this object which is granted by FormulaShare will be revoked when no longer valid. However, this ALSO means any manual and non-FormulaShare managed sharing on these objects will be removed too.
If a record isn&#39;t set here for a standard object, sharing set up by FormulaShare will remain even if the conditions which led to this sharing no longer apply.
Custom object sharing is always removed when no longer valid - this consideration is only needed for standard objects.</description>
